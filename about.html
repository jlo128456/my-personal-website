          My career has always been electronics-orientated. I love to troubleshoot problems down to components on printed circuit boards. 
        The skills I have gained over the years have improved my ability to find the most logical solutions to the problem. I am constantly 
        trying to acquire new knowledge in different areas. I am currently working on and API for my current company. The API will run the day to 
        day operation of the company.
